* Windows
** Windows permissions and domains
I have know idea how window's permission system works, and also what domains are
capable of
+ [X] Test
+ [X] Test2
+ [ ] Test 3

** Windows Registry
I know this is very important but can also nuke your system if youre not safe or
undstand what youre doing.
* Networking
** How OpenVPN/Wireguard work
I use them all the time, but I'm not sure exactly how they work the way they do.
** IPv6
I understand the gist of IPv4 but am not sure how IPv6 works exactly
** vLans
Just a more clear definition, i only have basic knowledge
** uPNP
Apparently this automatically forwards necessary ports when in use when
you router supports it, I have no idea how that would work.
