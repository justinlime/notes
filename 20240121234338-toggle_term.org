#+title: Toggle-Term

* Toggle Term
** Custom settings:
*** Seperate functions for showing, closing, and toggling the term
*** Function to select terminal
*** Option to switch to buffer upon showing
*** Option for termnial height percentage
*** Option for confirm on exit for terminals (steal from term-toggle.el)
*** Option/function for creating a new toggle term running a specific shell command at startup
*** Option for what shell to use, default being the env variable $SHELL
*** Term, Ansi Term, Shell, Eshell options
** Design
*** Show Terminal hook
*** Seperate functions/variables for
- toggle-window-visible-p or something along those line
- *toggle- for all package provided buffers  
- variable and function for getting the current buffer
- If a complicated alist is required, abstract it for the user


** Future thoughts:
*** Perspective integration, need to do this in a more graceful way
*** Make this more generalized, such as toggle-buffer or something, not limited to terms
